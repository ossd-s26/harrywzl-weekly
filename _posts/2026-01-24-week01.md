For me, open source is primarily about ownership and peace of mind. I prefer to keep my data and tools deployed locally rather than relying on cloud services, and open source software gives me the confidence to do that because I can audit the code myself at any time. The biggest advantage of this model is the educational value, it allows me to read the source code and see exactly how the best coders in the world think and solve complex problems, essentially letting me learn from the best. I would say the trade off is the friction, self-hosting demands technical patience that polished commercial tools usually automate away. I registered for this class because I want to move beyond just reading the code of these great projects to actually understanding how to contribute back to them.

## Projects I Use

My daily workflow relies on open source tools that prioritize privacy and local control:

* Bitwarden
* KeePass
* Homebrew
* VS Code
* AltTab
* OBS Studio
* LuLu
* OpenCode
