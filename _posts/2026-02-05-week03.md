## Work & Progress
We started by working through the Chrome extension Hello World tutorial as a team. It had some issues, like when Lu followed the wrong guidelines for firefox browser rather than the chrome browser we were working on and we helped him figure it out, and Jerry got stuck on the popups until he restarted his laptop to fix it. For our own extension, we brainstormed ideas including a Google Doc dark mode, a text magnifier, an assignment notifier that connects to school websites. We also discussed an email filter, a tab color changer, a compiler where you can highlight code and run it in the browser.
