### git add . vs git add <filename>:
I’ve always been guilty of using git add . out of pure laziness, but the exercises this week highlighted why git add <filename> is a routine I need to adopt. It forces you to be intentional about what you're staging rather than blindly sweeping everything, like including debug prints or unwanted config files, into the commit. It’s a small bit of friction that saves a massive headache later when you realize you accidentally committed a massive log file or broken code that you didn't mean to share.

### Cirq:
For the project evaluation, I looked at Cirq, Google’s open-source library for quantum circuits. Surprisingly, setting up the development environment on my Mac only took about five minutes—a rarity for a repo of this size. However, despite the seamless setup and a very active community, this is definitely not a beginner-friendly project. Because the domain barrier is so high, I’ve decided I won't be contributing to Cirq this semester, I need a project where I can fight the code, not the laws of physics.

### Refactoring Reality:
Outside of class, I’ve been bogged down at my internship refactoring a significant chunk of our web app, and honestly, it has been incredibly annoying. It feels less like engineering and more like archaeology, trying to decipher why previous developers made certain decisions without breaking the entire system. It is tedious work that drains my mental energy, reminding me that maintaining software is often 10% writing code and 90% untangling someone else's knots.
