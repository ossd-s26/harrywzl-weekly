## project
My primary goal for the group project is to contribute to high-utility developer tools, specifically targeting platforms like Appsmith or Visual Studio Code. The objective is to build functional features or develop extensions that provide direct, measurable value to the end-user. Currently, there are no blockers impeding progress. Success will rely on rigorous technical execution and efficient group communication. I will leverage my software development experience to handle the technical requirements and ensure the project maintains a strict timeline.

## contributions
**1** OpenStreetMap

**2** AI Repository Analyzer: For another class, I am contributing to an open-source web application that utilizes AI to parse repository data and recommend beginner-friendly contribution tickets. The work involves ensuring the AI correctly analyzes the repository context and outputs actionable, accessible tasks for new developers.

## project evaluation
ChatGPT cannot access live websites. This makes it impossible to use AI to accurately evaluate the actual state of an open-source project. If you rely on it for current metrics, it fabricates data. It will invent file links and guess issue counts. AI is a tool to learn. It helps explain codebases and concepts, but it is not a shortcut to cheat the manual research required for a real evaluation.
