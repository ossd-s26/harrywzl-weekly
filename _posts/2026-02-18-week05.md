## other projects
It was great seeing what other groups have been building. One project that really interesting was the browser extension where a popup appears just by hovering the mouse over the upper-right corner, and I already had some ideas for contributions while watching the presentation. Mind Melt and QuoteDaily were definitely the funniest projects of the bunch, they brought humor to the technical demonstrations.

## dev Process
My biggest takeaway from both our own work and watching others is that the development process rarely goes in a straight line. You can run into roadblocks that force a complete pivot.

For my group, this happened with our "Tab Color Changer" project. We originally targeted Chrome, but we quickly hit a wall when we realized Chrome’s API only allows users to group tabs, not color them individually. We had to pivot entirely to Firefox. Even then, we discovered that setting a tab color in Firefox would inadvertently change the entire browser theme. To fix this, we had to implement a background script to listen for the tab color changes and remember the state when the user returned to it. 

## Presentation Style
In terms of improving my own style, I’m taking a page out of Sebastian’s book. He mentioned a great tip for managing nerves and engagement: instead of scanning the whole room constantly, just make eye contact with one person or focus on one general area. It grounds the speaker and makes the delivery feel more personal. Definitely something I’ll be trying next time.

## Thoughts on the videos
My biggest takeaway from these videos is that even though AI is changing the game and bringing new security risks, the human connection in open source is what really matters. It was reassuring to see that a strong community of people simply looking out for one another is still our best defense against hacks and bad code.
